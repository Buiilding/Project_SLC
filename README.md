# Sign Language Classification Model (SignLingo)

## Introduction

The Sign Language Classification (SLC) model, SignLingo, is an artificial intelligence software designed to aid in the recognition and classification of sign language gestures for the deaf and hard of hearing community. This report describes the development and evaluation process of the SLC model, which was trained using the VGG architecture and achieved an accuracy of 94.5% in recognizing 27 different sign language classes.

## Characteristics of Sign Language for Deaf Students

Sign language is a distinctive means of communication for the deaf. Deaf students in elementary schools in Vietnam often use sign language as a primary tool for communication and learning. However, sign languages in Vietnam are not standardized, leading to the use of spontaneous and random sign combinations with gestures to convey meaning, resulting in inaccuracy and difficulties in giving information.

## Role of Language Forms in the Education of Deaf Students

Elementary school deaf students tend to use individual signs without forming sentences or adhering to sign language conventions. As a result, these students have the tendency to avoid learning sign language conventions, leveraging confusion between spontaneous signs and conventional signs.

## Significance and Applications of the Sign Language Classification Model

The SLC model is developed and trained with the VGG architecture to identify and classify sign language gestures, improving communication and interaction within the deaf community. The development of this model from an early age helps children establish relationships with others and be more exposed to the standard convention of sign language during their formative years. The SLC model also supports the educational process for deaf individuals in line with the recommendations of the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders.

## Conclusion

The Sign Language Classification Model is a valuable application that enhances communication and interaction within the deaf community, particularly for elementary school deaf students in Vietnam. The VGG architecture has demonstrated an accuracy of 94.5% in recognizing 27 sign language classes, showcasing the effectiveness and potential of this model. The development and application of the SLC model provide significant benefits to the deaf community, contributing to an improved quality of life and educational experience for such a society.
